Hi everyone :)

Welcome to my Github homepage.

-------------------------------------------
Please Install 

Tensorflow==1.5
scipy==1.2.0

Before running the python file.

Install commands are as follows.

pip install tensorflow==1.5.0
pip scipy==1.2.0
---------------------------------------------

- The file I uploaded is big, so It has a great chance to have an error when accessing it.
  So, if you get this problem, please try again.
- I did my best, but my script is not good actually I think.
- So if you find the wrong part, and if you get a chance, Comment please.

Thank you so much!!!
